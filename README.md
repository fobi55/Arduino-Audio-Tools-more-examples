First, thanks to pschatzmann, we have nice library to deal with audio streams: https://github.com/pschatzmann
There are nice examples there, but I faced little difficulties to do modifications for my purposes.
I started reading the classes in the library and  asking questions myself how to do this or that. 
Iâ€™ll share my findings here with examples, hope useful for someone.
